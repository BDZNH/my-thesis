author = "D.A. Huffman",
abstract = "An orderly procedure is developed by which the requirements of a sequential switching circuit (one with memory) can be reduced to the requirements of several combinational switching circuits (those without memory). Important in this procedure are: 1.1. the flow table: a tabular means by which the requirements of a sequential switching circuit may be stated precisely and by which redundancy in these requirements may be recognized and eliminated, and2.2. the transition index: a new variable which indicates the stability (or lack of stability) of a switching device. The role of those switching devices which are not directly controlled by the input of a sequential switching circuit is investigated thoroughly. The resulting philosophy, which is exploited in synthesis procedures for circuits using either relay or vacuum-tube switching devices, is valid for circuits using other devices as well."

abstract = "J. Hopcroft introduced already in 1970 an O(nlogn)-time algorithm for minimizing a finite deterministic automaton of n states. Although the existence of the algorithm is widely known, its theoretical justification, correctness and running time analysis are not. We give here a tutorial reconstruction of Hopcroft's algorithm focusing on a firm theoretical basis, clear correctness proofs and a well-founded computational analysis. Our analysis reveals that if the size of the input alphabet m is not fixed, then Hopcroft's original algorithm does not run in time O(mnlogn) as is commonly believed in the literature. The O(mnlogn) holds, however, for the variation presented later by D. Gries and for a new variant given in this article. We also propose a new efficient routine for refining the equivalence classes constructed in the algorithm and suggest a computationally sound heuristics as an enhancement."
